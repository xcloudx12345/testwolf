Network/HTTP/Date/Converter.hs:7:1: Warning:
    The import of ‘Control.Applicative’ is redundant
      except perhaps to import instances from ‘Control.Applicative’
    To import instances alone, use: import Control.Applicative()

Network/HTTP/Date/Converter.hs:97:6: Warning:
    This binding for ‘months’ shadows the existing binding
      imported from ‘Data.Time’ at Network/HTTP/Date/Converter.hs:9:1-16
      (and originally defined in ‘time-1.5.0.1:Data.Time.Format.Locale’)

Network/HTTP/Date/Converter.hs:100:19: Warning:
    In the use of ‘inlinePerformIO’
    (imported from Data.ByteString.Internal):
    Deprecated: "If you think you know what you are doing, use 'unsafePerformIO'. If you are sure you know what you are doing, use 'unsafeDupablePerformIO'. If you enjoy sharing an address space with a malevolent agent of chaos, try 'accursedUnutterablePerformIO'."
