Somehow forgotten with the coming of the Werewolves, the Witch has a chance to prove themself valuable to the village and maybe abolish the absurd pastime of burning and drowning their cult. The Witch is blessed (or maybe cursed) with the ability to make two powerful potions; one of which heals a victim of the Werewolves, the other poisons a player.
