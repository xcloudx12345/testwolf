Hah, maybe not as liked as the #{humanise jesterRole}, but the Drunk sure does their fair share of stupid things in the night! No-one knows if they even actually make it home; sometimes people see them sleeping outside the Blacksmith's home, others say they see them wandering towards the woods. It's pointless quizzing the Village Drunk in the morning about their doings; they can never remember what they did!
