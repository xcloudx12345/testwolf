Description : Response and message data structures.

A response is used as a return result of calling the @werewolf@ binary. Each response has a list of
associated messages.

@werewolf@ was designed to be ambivalent to the playing chat client. The response-message structure
reflects this by staying away from anything that could be construed as client-specific. This
includes features such as emoji support.

-- | When a user sends a command to the @werewolf@ binary, a response is always returned.

--   command was valid (indicated by the @ok@ flag) is often irrelevant as the returned @messages@
--   will include errors to the user.
