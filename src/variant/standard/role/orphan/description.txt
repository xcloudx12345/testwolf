Abandoned by their parents as a child, with no-one wanting to look after another mouth to feed, the Orphan was left to fend for themself. No-one looked twice at the Orphan and even fewer showed kindness towards the lonely child. One day however, one townsperson changed all this. He offered the Orphan food, water and a roof over their head. Grateful for his chairty and affection, the Orphan made him their role model. Pray that no ill should befall their role model, for they are the only one conforming the Orphan as a Villager.
