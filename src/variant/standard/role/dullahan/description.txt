Normally the Dullahan carries their head under one arm, however while amongst the Villagers, they ere on the side of caution and rest it in a more traditional place. The Dullahan rides a black horse as dark as night and hunts down travellers in the countryside. Beware if the Dullahan knows your name, for you are then marked for death and you should avoid them at all costs.
