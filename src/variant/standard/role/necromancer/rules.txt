Once per game the Necromancer can choose to resurrect all dead players as #{humanise zombieRole}s. The #{humanise zombieRole}s are aligned with the Necromancer and they cannot be lynched or devoured. If the Necromancer is killed, all #{humanise zombieRole}s die with them.
The Necromancer and #{humanise zombieRole}s win if they are the last ones alive.
